# « Claudators » : wikipedia offline edit tool

![|80](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xandru4/Claudators/refs/heads/main/claudators.png)

Are you good with Wikipedia markup and wish you could write at your on pace without being online?
Do you want to translate articles on your text editor of your choice without all the limitations on the official translation tool?
This tool, composed of a few simple and customizable scripts, will give you way more control and save you time when editing.

## Description

The scripts will assist you in fetching and doing simple operations to the source wikitext, in order to give you all the power. What you do with that text depends on you. Once fetched and treated, you may open on one side the draft and in another the original and make your modifications with your text editor of choice [^1].

## Legality

Following the relevant Wikipedia regulations is paramount, just as it is with the official tool. This is **not** a tool to automatically make translations or modifications, but a starting point to quickly get a working draft. Automatic unsupervised translations are prohibited on most wikipedias and the tool's output isn't perfect by any means. The editor should know the language of the articles and use the draft as a mere starting point. After the article has been translated and checked, all the sources from the original have to be added. Translating templates is not part of the scope of this project.

### Install

Clone this repository. Install the Dependencies:

```bash
sudo dnf install translate-shell python3 zenity
```

Then run the `installer.sh` to select the folder you wish to use:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/
unzip Claudators-main.zip
cd Claudators-main
chmod +x installer.sh
./installer.sh
```

### Translate

Launch the application through the desktop icon or by executing the `GUI.sh` file.

### Uninstall

Assuming you installed the application in the default directory, all you have to do to remove it is delete the directory along with the icon:

```bash
rm -r "$HOME/.claudators"
rm "$HOME/.local/share/applications/claudators.desktop"
```

### Scripts

The tool has been tested on linux (Fedora 41), but works well with WSL.

In the main shell script, different informations can be manually customized for every use-case.

The tool empowers to edit online but internet is obviously needed to fetch and to translate, which is done wither through the [Translate Shell](https://www.soimort.org/translate-shell/) project, which permits translation with several translation service or directly through the Deepl API, which offers the best result but is limited to a freemium offer.

**Smooth but in develloppement**:

- `installer.sh`
- `GUI.sh`
	- `wiki-fetch.py`
	- `wiki-refs.py`
	- `wiki-trans.py`
	- `wiki-add.py`
		- `wiki-es-1.txt`
 		- `wiki-es-2.txt`
		- `wiki-fr-1.txt`
 		- `wiki-language-N.txt`

**Rough but working**: `alpha.py`

### Tasks

- [X] Push the project on github
- [x] Make a few forms with Zenity
- [x] Separate the alpha into different one-purpose modular scripts
- [ ] The references functionality should offer the option to either
	- [x] Extract all the references (by default?)
	- [ ] Extract the URLSs (to add them via visual editor)
- [ ] Put the _model_ texts into separate files for each language
	- [x] Español
	- [ ] Français
- [x] Add `wp` before every translation and then either `raw` or a lang code on the local files
- [ ] Make python script to substitute templates (like: `Thumb` > `Miniatura`, `File` > `Archivo`) and quotation marks
- [ ] Add other translation options  such as google translate ([CLI google translate](https://ostechnix.com/use-google-translate-commandline-linux/))
	- [ ] Add a local translation tool	
- [ ] Make the normal use workflow by default with a button for the more complete interface (with all the options)
- [ ] Explore the wikipedia API to do other things (like automatically post to the sandbox or get internal link suggestions) [^2]
- [ ] Create specific error messages for specific issues (like no internet connection)
	- [x] Alternatively, the tool could work for local files so long articles can be handled manually?
- [x] Learn to make a desktop icon for the app (bash script and for the python environement too I guess...)
	- [x] Making a bash installer for the whole tool
	- [x] Ask for user input during setup
	- [x] Give it a good name and logo
- [ ] Add a new functionality to suggest backlinks to the the original article that could be made on the translation
- [ ] Use [markdown-wiki](https://github.com/Gozala/markdown-wiki) for the user to be able to translate in actual markdown
- [ ] Make the whole app into an Obsidian/QownNotes/Vscode plugin? [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQCc7HYOfpY) or [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgXa03ZxJ88)

[^1]:Obsidian or the gnome text editor is what I use, but you may simply use notepad or vim for a minimalist approach.
