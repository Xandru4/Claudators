# Wikipedia offline edit

### Aims

Are proficient in Wikipedia markup and tired of being limited to be online in order to edit an article? Do you want to translate on the text editor of your choice without all the limitations on the offcial translation tool?

This tool (still in devellopement) will help you with all that with a few simple and customisable scripts that will give you way more control when editing wiki source code.

The scripts will assist you in fetching and doing simple operations to the source text, in order to give you all the power, but what you do with that text depends on you. Once fetched, you may make your modifications in your editor of choice [obsidian or the gnome text editor is what I use, but you may simply use notepad or vim for a minimalist approach]. Following the relevant Wikipedia regulations is paramount, just as with any other tool. This is not a tool to automatically make translations or modifications but a starting point to quickly get a woking draft.
