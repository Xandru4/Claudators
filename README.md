# Wikipedia offline edit

### Aims

Are proficient in Wikipedia markup and tired of being limited to be online in order to edit an article? Do you want to translate on the text editor of your choice without all the limitations on the offcial translation tool?

This tool (still in devellopement) will help you with all that with a few simple and customisable scripts that will give you way more control when editing wiki source code.
